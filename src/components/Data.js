        description: "Executed data preprocessing and exploratory analysis on a heart disease-related dataset, extracting insights to enhance comprehension and optimize data scaling techniques. Selected key features for model building using ANOVA and Chi-Squared tests, and scaled data for modeling depending on the requirements of the model and distribution of the features. Implemented diverse machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, NBC, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest), rigorously evaluating each using key metrics, confusion matrices, and AUC-ROC graphs to accurately gauge each modelâ€™s effectiveness.",
